## Monetization/Tokenomics

How do existing runner games monetize?
https://gameanalytics.com/blog/monetizing-an-infinite-runner-guest-post/#:~:text=Breaking%20Down%20Monetization,-As%20said%20before&text=Revenue%20of%20a%20free%2Dto,size%20of%20a%20purchase%20made.&text=The%20combination%20of%20new%20players,players%20base%20of%20your%20game.

"When it comes to progression, infinite runners are pretty much all clones. Each run earns the player soft currency, which is then used to enhance player attributes or to unlock new characters."

* NFTs
  * PFPs
  * Certain traits can have in-game physics changes, e.g. astronaut helmet gives lower gravity
* Egg mechanic where you need to pay the incubators $DINO to incubate egg + run certain amount of time to hatch the NFTs (like pokemon)
  * 50% of $DINO immediately sold for $NEAR and LP'd to build protocol-owned liquidity
* Incentivized "continues".
  * Integrate with Brave ads SDK, and watch ad to continue game, or pay small amount of $DINO to continue.
  * Maybe a mechanic to incentivize continues is you can collect coins, but can't claim them until you pass a checkpoint (night/day shift). If you die, you lose tokens you claimed in current day cycle.


Tetranode's top mistakes in tokenomics:

* Too large insider allocations
* Buybacks
    * Instead, stake to earn fees, or invest in treasury
* Having a fully unlocked pool 2 - scale up rewards based on how long you've locked you liquidity. Example, FXS liquidity mining scales linearly based on how long you lock , from 1-3x



Ok so to sustain $DINO it needs to have utility - i.e. be a business
You need Dino token to
* Incubate new Dinos
* Dino skins
